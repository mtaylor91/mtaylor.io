      <h2>Science and the Meta-Crisis</h2>
      <p>
        Climate change, biodiversity loss, growing economic inequality, and the rise of
        authoritarianism are all symptoms of a global system that is failing to meet the
        needs of people and the planet. This is the Meta-Crisis. As one of our key
        mechanisms for understanding the world, science has a critical role to play in
        addressing the Meta-Crisis. Without adequate understanding it will be impossible
        for humanity to navigate the difficulties we now face.
      </p>
      <p>
        The search for understanding is the search for truth. There are two kinds of
        truth. One kind is generated through observation, the other kind is generated
        through action.  Active truth exists in the present and shapes the future,
        while observed truth examines the past. The role of science is to observe,
        collect, and disseminate insights from the past to guide our collective choices
        in the present towards a more desirable future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Traditionally science has contented itself to focus on questions of what is
        rather than on questions of what ought to be. In democratic society such
        questions are better left to business leaders and policymakers, so the thinking
        goes. But science has powerful tools to model and forecast systems that allow
        us to anticipate the future and react to situations that arise in the present
        with greater insight and wisdom. Now more than ever the voice of scientific
        reason is needed in the public discourse surrounding how to navigate the current
        crises.
      </p>

        The rise of populism in the world has signaled a growing distrust in
        institutions. With faith in institutions at an all-time low, how can institutions
        reform themselves to regain public trust and reinsert themselves into a secure
        position of moral authority? The answer is simple. Institutions have lost the
        public trust by abandoning the public interest. Rampant corruption has lead to
        growing inequality that has alienated the institutional elite from the public
        and vice-versa. To regain the faith of the public, institutions must
        re-prioritize the interests of the public.
      </p>
      <p>
        How can this be achieved? With economic uncertainty looming on the horizon, we
        now face the threat of austerity. At a time when public faith in institutions
        is at an all time low, the continued erosion of the support those institutions
        offer the public could prove catastrophic. Money is not a scarce resource.
        Doctors are scarce resources. Teachers are scarce resources. We should be doing
        everything we can to make education as abundant as possible. Instead we focus on
        making it as profitable as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the heart of the issue is a falsehood professed by the science of economics.
        That falsehood is that value can be objectively measured. What is value? Value is
        simply the combination of desire and need. While it is certainly true that the
        desires and needs of individuals can in a certain sense be objectively discussed
        and perhaps even quantified, it is not the case that individual desires and needs
        can simply be aggregated, as is commonly assumed by economists.
      </p>
      <p>
        What's needed is a new philosophy of truth and value. A new set of processes,
        systems, and structures built for the 21st century using the tools and techniques
        of the 21st century. We should not forget the lessons of the past, but neither
        should we shy away from the challenges of the present. We need to rethink our
        relationship to education and to work. We can no longer afford to live in silos.
        We started building a nervous system for the planet when we built the internet
        and used it to power our economies. It's time to make that nervous system
        responsive to the needs of the planet and humanity as a whole.
