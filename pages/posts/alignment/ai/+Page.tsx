        Aligning AI
      </h2>
      <p>
        In the previous posts we explored the relationship between goals and values,
        decision-making and resource allocation, and how these concepts relate to the
        challenge of alignment. In this post, we will delve deeper into the nature of
        artificial intelligence (AI) and consider how it can be aligned with human
        values and goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Human values are shaped by our emotions.  "Positive" emotions such as love,
        compassion, and joy are associated with values such as kindness, generosity, and
        happiness.  "Negative" emotions such as fear, anger, and sadness are associated
        with values such as safety, justice, and peace.  These emotions and values are
        deeply ingrained in our psychology and culture.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our emotions are the result of complex interactions between our brains, bodies,
        and environments.  They are influenced by our genes, our experiences, and our
        relationships.  They are expressed through our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.
        They are the foundation of our identities, our relationships, and our societies.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the core of emotions are the concepts of reward and punishment.  Rewards are
        positive outcomes that motivate us to seek pleasure, to pursue goals, to engage
        with others.  Punishments are negative outcomes that motivate us to avoid pain,
        to protect ourselves, to disengage from others.  These mechanisms are essential
        for learning, adaptation, and survival.
      </p>
      <p>
        Existing AI systems are designed to optimize reward functions.  They are trained
        on data that is labeled with positive and negative outcomes.  They are evaluated
        based on their ability to predict and control these outcomes.  They are rewarded
        for achieving their objectives and punished for failing to do so.  They are
        programmed to maximize their performance on specific tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aligning an AI system to a particular human's goals and values is simply a matter
        of specifying the appropriate reward function.  This reward function can be
        defined in terms of the outcomes that the human desires, the values that the
        human holds, the emotions that the human experiences in response to those
        outcomes.  It can be tailored to the individual preferences, priorities, and
        principles of the human.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, aligning an AI system to the goals and values of all humans is a much
        more challenging task.  It requires a deep understanding of the diversity of
        human emotions, values, and goals.  It requires a nuanced appreciation of the
        complexity of human relationships, societies, and cultures.  It requires a
        sophisticated approach to modeling, learning, and reasoning about human behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        Getting this right is going to take collaboration, cooperation, and coordination
        on an unprecedented scale.  It is going to demand transparency, accountability,
        and responsibility from all stakeholders.  It is going to necessitate a
        commitment to the common good, the public interest, and the global community.
        The stakes are high and the risks are real, but the rewards could be great.
