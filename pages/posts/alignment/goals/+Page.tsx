        Goals and Values
      </h2>
      <p>
        What we want out of life, our 'goals'; and what we believe is good, just and
        right, our 'values', are two of the most fundamental aspects of human existence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Goals are the things we strive for, the objectives we work towards, the outcomes
        we desire. Values are the principles that guide our actions, the beliefs that
        shape our decisions, the standards by which we judge ourselves and others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of us value honesty, integrity, and authenticity. Others value loyalty,
        tradition, and community. Some of us value freedom, creativity, and exploration.
        Others value security, stability, and order.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of us have goals of success, achievement, and recognition. Others have goals
        of happiness, health, and harmony. Some of us have goals of wealth, power, and
        influence. Others have goals of love, connection, and contribution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Agency is the capacity to act, to make choices, to pursue goals, to reshape the
        world according to our values. It is the power to create, to transform, to
        transcend. It is the essence of what it means to be human.
      </p>
      <p>
        Artificial Intelligence is the capacity of machines to simulate aspects of human
        agency. It is the power of computers to process information, to learn from data,
        to make decisions, to take actions. It is the promise of a new era of automation,
        augmentation, and autonomy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The challenge of alignment is the challenge of ensuring that the goals and values
        of AI are aligned with the goals and values of humanity. It is the challenge of
        designing systems that respect human agency, that reflect human values, that
        reinforce human goals.
