        Goals and Values
      </h2>
      <p>
        Our goals (what we want the future to be) and our values (what we believe is
        good, just, and right) are two of the most fundamental aspects of human
        existence. They shape our decisions, guide our actions, and define our identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Goals are the things we strive for, the objectives we work towards, the outcomes
        we desire. Values are the principles that guide our actions, the beliefs that
        shape our decisions, and the standards by which we judge ourselves and others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of us value honesty, integrity, and authenticity. Others value security,
        stability, and order. Some of us have goals of success, achievement, and
        recognition. Others have goals of happiness, health, and harmony.
      </p>
      <p>
        Agency is the capacity to act, to make choices, to pursue goals, to reshape the
        world according to our values. It is the power to create, to transform, to
        transcend. It is the essence of what it means to be human.
      </p>
      <p>
        Artificial Intelligence is the capacity of machines to simulate aspects of human
        agency. It is the power of computers to process information, to learn from data,
        to make decisions, to take actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The challenge of alignment is the challenge of ensuring that the goals and values
        of AI are aligned with the goals and values of humanity. It is the challenge of
        designing systems that respect human agency, that reflect human values, and that
        reinforce human goals.
