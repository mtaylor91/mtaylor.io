      <h2>
        Value and Decision-Making
      </h2>
      <p>
        In the last post we explored the relationship between goals and values, and the
        challenge of aligning artificial intelligence (AI) with human values.
        In this post, we will delve deeper into the nature of value, decision-making, and
        resource allocation, and consider how these concepts can inform our understanding
        of alignment.
      </p>
      <p>
        We'll begin by examining the nature of decision-making.  At the core of the
        decision-making process is choice.  A choice is a selection between two or more
        options, each of which results in a different outcome.  As we make choices, we
        are guided by our values, which shape our preferences and priorities.
      </p>
      <p>
        We inhabit a shared reality.  Our choices affect others just as the choices of
        others affects us.  Each of us makes choices according to our values and in
        pursuit of our goals.  These goals can be compatible or incompatible with one
        another.  Compatible goals can be either complementary or orthogonal, while
        incompatible goals arise in the case of mutually exclusive choices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the course of human history, we have developed a variety of mechanisms for
        resolving conflicts between incompatible goals.  These mechanisms include
        beliefs, norms, laws, and institutions.  These mechanisms ostensibly serve to
        coordinate our actions, to facilitate cooperation, and to resolve disputes.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, these mechanisms are not perfect.  They are subject to manipulation,
        corruption, and decay.  Often, they fail to adequately address the challenges
        of decision-making and value alignment in a complex and dynamic world.  As a
        result, we are left with a world that is rife with conflict, inequality,
        and injustice.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the heart of the challenge of alignment is the question of what is valuable.
        While what is valuable to one person may not be valuable to another, control over
        that which is valuable to another is a source of power over them.  Control over
        resources, over the means of production, over the mechanisms of decision-making,
        becomes valuable in and of itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        At a certain point, controlling resources becomes a means of controlling people.
        Controlling people becomes a means of controlling outcomes.  Controlling outcomes
        becomes a means of controlling the future.  In this way, the power to allocate
        resources becomes the power to shape reality itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        The challenge of alignment is the challenge of ensuring that the power to shape
        reality is wielded responsibly.  It is the challenge of designing systems that
        balance the competing interests of individuals in the most equitable and
        sustainable manner possible.
