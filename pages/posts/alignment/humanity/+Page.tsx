      <h2>
        Aligning Humanity
      </h2>
      <p>
        So far we've explored the relationship between goals and values, decision-making
        and resource allocation, and the challenge of aligning artificial intelligence
        (AI) with human values. In this post, we will consider how these concepts can be
        applied to the challenge of aligning humanity itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        What do I mean by aligning humanity? I mean the process of ensuring that the
        goals and values of individuals, groups, and societies are compatible with one
        another and with the broader goals and values of humanity as a whole. I mean the
        process of resolving conflicts, coordinating actions, and facilitating
        cooperation between diverse and sometimes divergent interests.
      </p>
      <p>
        The process is pretty simple:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Identify the goals and values of individuals, groups, and societies.
        </li>
        <li>
          Identify the conflicts and compatibilities between these goals and values.
        </li>
        <li>
          Develop mechanisms for resolving conflicts and coordinating actions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Implement these mechanisms through norms, laws, and institutions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Monitor and adjust these mechanisms as needed.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>
        Identifying Goals and Values
      </h3>
      <p>
        We can't just assume that everyone wants the same things or believes the same
        things. We have to ask people what they want and what they believe. We have to
        listen to their answers and take them seriously. We have to recognize that people
        are diverse and that their goals and values are shaped by their experiences,
        relationships, and environments.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Identifying Conflicts and Compatibilities
      </h3>
      <p>
        Once we know what people want and believe, we can start to look for conflicts and
        compatibilities between their goals and values. Much of the time, we'll find that
        our goals and values are orthogonal or even complementary to one another. But
        sometimes we'll find that they are incompatible or even in direct opposition to
        one another. In these cases, we'll need to work together to find solutions that
        respect everyone's interests and concerns.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Developing Mechanisms for Resolving Conflicts and Coordinating Actions
      </h3>
      <p>
        Developing mechanisms for resolving conflicts and coordinating actions is an
        ongoing and iterative process. It requires creativity, flexibility, and
        collaboration, as well as a willingness to listen, learn, and compromise.
        While technology can offer new tools and techniques for achieving these goals,
        ultimately it is up to us as individuals, groups, and societies to make the
        decisions and take the actions that will shape our future.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Implementing Mechanisms Through Norms, Laws, and Institutions
      </h3>
      <p>
        Norms, laws, and institutions are the means by which we codify and enforce the
        rules that govern our interactions and relationships. They are the mechanisms
        through which we express our values, resolve our conflicts, and coordinate our
        actions. They are the foundation of our societies, the fabric of our cultures,
        the structure of our civilizations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our norms, laws, and insitutions are becoming stagnant, corrupt, and ineffective.
        They are failing to adequately address the challenges of the 21st century, from
        climate change and pandemics to inequality and injustice. They are struggling to
        keep pace with the rapid pace of technological change, social transformation, and
        geopolitical upheaval.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Monitoring and Adjusting Mechanisms as Needed
      </h3>
      <p>
        Our norms, laws, and institutions are not set in stone. They can be changed,
        adapted, and improved over time. They can be updated to reflect new knowledge,
        new technologies, and a better understanding of our shared values and goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end of the day, aligning humanity is a collective endeavor. It requires
        the active participation of individuals, groups, and societies from around the
        world. If we don't step up and take responsibility for shaping our future, then
        who will?
